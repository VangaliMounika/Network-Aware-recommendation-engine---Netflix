This project develops a **Network-Aware Recommendation Engine for Netflix Streaming** that integrates real-time internet speed monitoring into content recommendation algorithms to optimize streaming quality. The aim is to adjust recommendations based on current network conditions, minimizing buffering and ensuring high-quality playback.

Traditional recommendation systems fail to consider network performance, often resulting in poor streaming experiences. By leveraging real-time bandwidth data, the proposed system dynamically filters content to match the available network speed, thereby enhancing user satisfaction. 

The research shows that incorporating network awareness into recommendation algorithms significantly improves streaming performance, especially in fluctuating network conditions. Future work should focus on predictive analytics for better network performance forecasting and expanding the systemâ€™s scalability to diverse environments. Additionally, the system could be extended to handle various content types, such as live streaming and high-definition video.

This project contributes new knowledge by demonstrating how integrating real-time network data into recommendation engines can provide a more personalized and efficient streaming experience.

## Proposed Solution
A network-aware engine that:
- Monitors bandwidth in real time
- Filters or adapts content suggestions accordingly
- Offers personalized, high-quality content based on network speed
